Since seeing Tron Legacy I've been sort of obsessed with the style of the UI on Flynn's computer. So, I thought, why not try to make my Terminal look as close to that as I can?

The Font
Thanks to Robin Willis (@robincwillis on Twitter) for notifying me [1] that the font used in Tron Legacy was Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, which you can get here [2].

Side note: It'd be great if the iPad's UI was theme-able and someone with considerable skills made a Tron Legacy UI but that isn't the world we live in. So, I'm stuck with this.
